# README

This is a basic API for mocking the needs of the [buyer frontend](https://github.com/maugsbur/UNICEF-innovations-challenge) which doesn't itself need a backend (except sales, but that is another project). It should be replaced by several more complete APIs: Products, Storage, Users, etc.

The API could have been mocked in the front end application, but this way enables to show some of what the back end could look like.
